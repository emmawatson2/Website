<br>Photo Courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p>Trinity Unversity is ranked #41 on Wall Street's ranking of the best liberal arts colleges in the US and #2 for best colleges in the nation for merit aid on Money Magazine. The campus is beautiful with unique red buildings and large old trees. It has a modern, unique layout the surrounds the famous Miller fountain at the center of campus. Class sizes are small to give students a good learning experience, where they can ask for help when they need it. Trinity Univerisity is a very unique school different from any other.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the beautiful campus, the small class sizes, and the overall uniqueness. Trinity's campus has both modern buildings with the feel of an old school, and I love the brick on almost every building. Miller Fountain at the center of campus is also where students are dunked on their birthday, which I think is a really fun tradition. The small class sizes help me learn better and I'm able to ask questions when I need to, and actually know the people around me. Trinity does things different from other schools, like pathways and the first year experience. These unique classes and pathways are a lot of work, but force people to take classes and learn about things they never would have learned before. This can be good for people who don't know exactly what they're majoring in or what they want to do with their life. Trinity is a tough school, but I love it so far. </p>

<p>I chose Trinity University because I just liked the feel of campus. It sounds silly, but I just went on a tour and fell in love with it. Everyone was really talkitive and nice, and the campus was gorgeous. I knew I was most likely going to go to Trinity before I even applied, since I got such a good feeling from it. I also wanted to go to a small school with small classes, but didn't want to be in the middle of nowhere; lots of small schools are located in small towns. Trinity is so close to downtown, and San Antonio is such a cool city. There's always something going on. It's the best of both worlds: a small school in a big city with lots of opprotunities.</p>
<p>I am thinking about double-majoring in Political Science and Communications. I loved history and government in high school, and I'd like to learn more about the political system of the US and how politics work. I've also heard that communications is a good major, and I'd like to get better at public speaking and communication in general. The classes sound really interesting as well. I'm not in any political science or communications classes this semester, but I am excited to take classes in those majors next semester. Here are some links to important information about political science and communications:
